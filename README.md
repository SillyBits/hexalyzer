'Hexalyzer' v0.1 alpha
(c) 2019 SillyBits


'Hexalyzer' assists you with analyzing binary files.
Still very poor performance with files bigger 1MB, but I'm at it ^^

This tool is meant as an educational helper, always 
respect the file's original rights ;)
It's open source and available for free at 
https://github.com/SillyBits/hexalyzer/.

Some icons in this tool are taken from icons8, 
visit https://icons8.com/ for more details.

Cheers, and have fun investigating your binaries :D
